++ Delete

+++ My delete function works in a very strange way. It will first prompt you for the employee number of
the employee you are trying to delete as normal, but then it will prompt you for their position in the Array and 
delete whoever is at that position regardless. This is because I wanted to add a question "Are you sure you want to remove (Employee Name)"?
but then I couldn't figure out how to change the Input type to a Boolean instead of a Int.
So I used the removeAt() function instead of the remove() function which removes the object by its position in the 
Array.

++ Search By Name 

+++ I added a search by name function which allows you to search the employee up by their first name 
instead of their employee number.

++ Sort by Salary Low - High

+++ I added a lambdas that sorts the objects by their salary variable low to high, and prints the result First Name, Last Name, Salary.
