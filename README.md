++ Delete

+++ I added a function to delete employees from the list. When you choose to delete and employee you will first be prompted for their employee number.
You will then be asked if you are sure you want to delete this person. You can answer "Yes" or "No" but the first letter of the answer needs to be to uppercase.
If you say "Yes" the employee will be deleted, but if you say "No" it will print "Nevermind"
